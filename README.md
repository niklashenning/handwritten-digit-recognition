## About
This basic machine learning model is trained on the [HwD-1000 dataset](https://github.com/niklashenning/hwd-1000-dataset)
and is able to accurately classify and recognize digits from images.<br>
It utilizes PyTorch's neural networks and Tensor libraries for training the model, pandas for loading
and handling the dataset, Pillow for loading and converting the images, and Matplotlib
for visualizing the training results.
